# Simple use of AI Search as a vector store
This example starts with text files as a starting point, and has custom code that will vectorise and push these into a search index that you can then query. 

It then goes on to demonstrate how to use open source code to evaluate your RAG solution.

Follow the readme in this repo to run through the setup test (one document) and then run over the sample dataset provided: 

## Exercise
:point_right: [Clone this repo](https://github.com/lindacmsheard/rag-eval/tree/contrib) and then switch to the 'contrib' branch before running through it.

:bulb: Note that you can then find and query your vector search index in the Azure Portal blade of the search service - we will use that later on.
